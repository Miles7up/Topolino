###### This marks the adventure of a Restaurant, which wants to **expand** their **influence** in **social media** and make **more revenue** through selling their products **online**.
<hr></hr>

### This can be achieved in multiple ways!

- A more visual Story
  - _In order to improve the relation to the customer_

- Through food imagery
  - _Which shall be an appetizer to the real dish and show what they got to offer_

- An online shop
  - _That might help to sell their products even when the customer is not able to dive into their desired ambient, or maybe create their own at a desired location_

- Show some of their achievements
  - _In Catering, or maybe upgrades in their restaurants, this can be done through a Blog or an Impressum_

<hr></hr>

### Main goal

###### We want to optimize and make it easier to use and maintain for the restaurant owners, a redesign of the existing site is planned.
